pdf-fdf-generator
=================

Generate PDF files containing forms, filled with values using FDF files and PDFtk for NodeJS.

I had some problems while building iconv as a sub-dependency, pelase try:

```bash
npm install --unsafe-perm
```

Test (informal), directly from package root directory:
```bash
user@server ~/pdf-fdf-generator $ coffee test/test.coffee
```
